The Genetic Algorithm focusses on finding the best possible flight from one city to another.
The fitness of a particlar flight is defined by the time it takes and the price of a ticket on the flight.
The best flights from a particular population are chosen for crossover leading to better flights.
Each iteration leads to the creation of a new generation which leads to creation of new better offsprings. 
The logger displays the fitness of the new species, the fitness of the one culled in that iteration and the fitness of the new species before and after mutation if mutation takes place.
